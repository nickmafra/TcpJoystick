# TcpJoystick

An android app to be used as a joystick, using TCP communication.

Suggestion: install vJoy to simulate a joystick on Windows and SC vJoy Server to bridge the gap between the android app and vJoy.

TODO List:

- use accelerometer
- load joystick layout dynamically
- fast change between joystick layouts
